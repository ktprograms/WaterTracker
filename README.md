# WaterTracker

## About
WaterTracker is a simple app that reminds you to drink water!

Simply tap on each glass to 'drink'. The glasses go down from full to empty at each tap. Alarm of your chosen duration (re)starts every time you touch a glass.

A 'Drink water!' notification like shown above will be displayed if you have not 'drank' for your chosen duration. Tapping the notification goes to the app.

When all 5 glasses are empty, the notifications will no longer come (until you restart them), and a 'Congratulations' message will appear!
