# WaterTracker

## About
WaterTracker is a simple app that reminds you to drink water!

![Image1](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/1.png?raw=true)
Simply tap on each glass to 'drink'. The glasses go down from full to empty at each tap. Alarm of your chosen duration (re)starts every time you touch a glass.

A 'Drink water!' notification like shown above will be displayed if you have not 'drank' for your chosen duration. Tapping the notification opens the app.
<hr />

When all 5 glasses are empty, the notifications will no longer come (until you restart them), and a 'Congratulations' message will appear!
